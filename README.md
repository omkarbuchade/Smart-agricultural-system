# Smart-agricultural-system
Smart agricultural system based on data analytics to recommend most producible crops to farmers.
This work presents a system, in form of a website. The business logic in python uses Machine Learning techniques in order to predict the most profitable crop in the current weather and soil conditions. The proposed system will integrate the data obtained from soil, crop repository, weather department and by applying machine learning algorithm: Multiple Linear Regression, a prediction of most suitable crops according to current environmental conditions is made. This provides a farmer with variety of options of crops that can be cultivated.

The business logic can be located in /code/mlr_algo.py directory.
THe server is programmed using node.js. To execute the project you just need to run the node.js- 'server.js' script and navigate to the displayed ip address on the prompt to access the system.

Python package Stack: scikit-learn, pandas.
Web development technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
All the required datasets included in the repository itself.
